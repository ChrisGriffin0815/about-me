    <P class="tab">Hi, my name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Griffin">Chris Griffin</a>, I have two young children named Leo and Rosabel. I traveled the west with <b>Union Pacific Railroad</b> for <i>twenty two </i>years and have decided to quit that job and hang out with my kids instead: <ol><li>Leo</li><li>Rosabel</li></ol> I'm excited to see where this path will take me and also for a new set of challenges, I was <u>unconciously competent</u> at railraoding for the last decade.</P>
